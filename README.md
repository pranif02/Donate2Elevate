# Donate2Elevate:Book Donation Website
* We know currently many students may have a large number of books that they no longer need 
or use, but they don't really know what to do with them or how to donate them effectively. 
This can lead to a large amount of waste and a missed opportunity to share knowledge and 
promote literacy. 
* This project is used to develop a website that would help students to donate their textbooks 
or other study materials, so that it would benefit other students those who cannot afford 
it.There will be a home page which contains section about various categories of books, gallery, 
links to login and signup page , next a login page or a signup page, then a main page where the 
user can enter the details of book he or she wishes to donate and all these information is stored in 
the MySQL database to retrieve meaningful information.
